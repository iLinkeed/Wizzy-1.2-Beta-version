# Wizzy-1.2-Beta-version
Hi!! So after a lot of feedback from "Wizzy 1.1" I've decided it's best that I give it an update. So here we are with Wizzy 1.2!! Faster and more reliabe
So this bot is a little different guys. I don't have time to upload a video on how to use it because it's pretty simple and that can wait.
1st step - Unzip the folder and when you open it you'll notice theres a shortcut called "Wizzy". Run it and Wizzy will open up greeting you with the new interface
Next you'll notice we added a few more tabs, a vc token logger (get your bot in the vc and take tokens only works in servers), and an account nuker. 
The tutorial help menu will pop up shortly after running the file and will explain everything from where I've left off.
Enjoy wizzy 1.2, Happy Wizzing :)
