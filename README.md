# Wizzy 1.2 BETA

Hi!! So after a lot of feedback from "Wizzy 1.1" I've decided it's best that I give it an update.
 So here we are with Wizzy 1.2!!
 Faster and more reliabe So this bot is a little different guys.
 I don't have time to upload a video on how to use it because it's pretty simple and that can wait. 
 1st step - Unzip the folder and when you open it you'll notice theres a shortcut called "Wizzy". 
 Run it and Wizzy will open up greeting you with the new interface Next you'll notice we added a few more tabs, a vc token logger (get your bot in the vc and take tokens only works in servers)
 and an account nuker. The tutorial help menu will pop up shortly after running the file and will explain everything from where I've left off.
 Enjoy wizzy 1.2, Happy Wizzing :)

## Why should I try Wizzy 1.2?

Good question!! But why stay with 1.1 when theres something bigger and better for FREE!! Wizzy will always be a free project and will always be open to the public
Also wizzy is more than just raiding a server now. Why not become a hacker with wizzy? Log peoples tokens in a voice chat!! Nuke entire accounts!! Nothing is impossible with Wizzy 1.2 at your disposal.
Share the news with all your friends and start hacker groups!! The possibilities are endless!

I've been really busy with other projects and personal matters to ever get around to creating a youtube tutorial but best believe one will be posted shortly after this post.

## Account Nuker Included

Now Wizzy has had alot of competition over the years with other Raid bot projects. We're going to end all of that. No other "free" Wizz/Raiding software has included a token logger and Account Nuker in their application

We humbly believe that the public should have FREE access to all of these applications and source code.
